Break down the following short story into {num_scenes} distinct visual scenes for a narrated slideshow:

STORY:
{story_text}

For each scene:
1. Create a detailed visual description for image generation
2. Extract the narration text that should accompany this visual
3. Suggest a brief emotional tone for this scene (e.g., "mysterious", "joyful", "tense")

Format your response as a JSON array with this structure:
[
    {
        "description": "Detailed visual description for image generation (no text in image)",
        "narration": "Text that should be read during this scene",
        "tone": "emotional tone of the scene",
        "image_prompt": "Optimized prompt for DALL-E image generation with style guidance"
    },
    // additional scenes...
]

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Make each scene visually distinct
- Description should focus on what should be SEEN in the image
- Narration should be the exact text from the story that corresponds to this scene
- The image_prompt should be detailed and include artistic style guidance
- Don't include text overlay instructions in image descriptions
- Keep the original story's emotional tone
